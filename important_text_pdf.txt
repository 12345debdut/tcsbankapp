*We have added pdf generation in our project it is operating system oriented.
*If you're using windows server then it will work. But incase of linux server it will not work for the os dependency.
*We have no linux machine so we haven't tested it out.
*Proccedure for linux machine.
*run 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xvfb libfontconfig wkhtmltopdf

and find the path of wkhtmltopdf and replace it to the enviournment variable called 

PDF_WKTHTMLTOPDF_PATH="<your path to wkhtmltopdf>"
then it will work fine.
